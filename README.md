## Project Requirements

### Content
#### Design choice
The colours were selected from a randomly generated palette from coolers.com and inspired by variations on my favourite colors (purple, teal and blue). Choice and combination of font colours were based on optimising visiblity using whocanuse.com. 
Stylistically the design is a lot bolder than I had originally planned (before being advised we had to use at least 3 colours!). I like the colour combination but will design over time if it suits the aesthetic I was trying to achieve.

#### Biography
My biography, while exagerating my skills as a devloper, is built on my background in information architecture (which I majored in). Once I have developed the technical skills I belive this knowledge and experience provides a unique angle to market my skills. 
As my skills and relevant CV becomes more advanced, I would consider having this as a standalone page.

#### Profile picture
Profile picture chosen that clearly displays me, but also with the glasses and hat maintains a small level of anonymity. The colours go well with the colour palette too - with the small splash of teal. It is probably a bit larger than I'd like - but "done is better than perfect"!

#### Functional contact form
Form has been set up using Formspree.
At present this is intended to appear on the footer of each page. As the website develops, this may be moved to a standalone contact page.

#### My Projects
Intention would be to have a couple of the most recent (or perhaps high-profile) listed on the home page. A separate projects page has been created which will list all projects (completed and in progress) along with programming language(s) used for the project. This page will provide a sentence or two description of each project. Ultimately I intend to then have separate pages for each project (child pages to the Project page) where there will be a most detailed description / case study of the project. This was included in the wireframe but I did not get the opportunity to create for the assignment deadline.

#### External links
A link to my LinkedIn Profile and GitHub has been included beneath the profile picture. These have been included as icons. In addition, text links have been included in the footer. This was originally images but was changed to be text as I felt it worked better stylistically.
For some reason there is a  small ine between the two, which happened with the SheCodes site too. Can't remember how I had fixed that so it's staying for the moment!
​
### Technical
#### Site pages
At present only two pages have been created - Home and Projects. As indicated above, future ideas for the site include a stand alone About Me page, as well as pages for each project. A seperate Contact page could also be considered, or it could be left within the footer.
In-page links have been utilised for both existing pages, to take users directly into content lower on page.

#### Git and GutHub
Regular commits were made to the develop branch to ensure changers were saved to remote server. Commit messages were given descriptions to indicate what changes had been made in each version.
The main branch was updated at the completion of the project. Had to update a couple of times once 'live' to fix the errors.

#### Responsive design
A focus of this assignment was trying to implement responsive design principles. I tried to implement mobile-first design principles. Responsive design was then added for screen sizes min-700px and min-900px. Main features of responsive design include width of margin / white space on left and right of display and switch from column to row.

#### Semantic HTML
Header, section, nav and footer have been used in the site. 

### Bonus (optional)
#### Hover styles
A late addition was the change in colour for the navigation links - going from a white background to a purple background when the mouse hovered over the box. The same style was applied to both the site nav and in-page navs, but stylistically they look slightly different as i-page nav has a border.
